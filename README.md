# Portfolio-Website

This repository contains the source code for my blog.

It was build using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as the static web-page generator, and [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Capm96/Capm96.github.io) as the host.

## Credits
Making this website would have not been possible without Themefisher's [Meghna Hugo Theme](https://github.com/themefisher/meghna-hugo), which I used as the foundational template for the website. The majority of the code in this repository is of their creation, which I am simply customizing for my own website.
