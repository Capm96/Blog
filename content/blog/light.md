If you were asked to explain the single most implausible thing you know, but which is also true without a doubt, what would it be?

I would be hard pressed to find a single answer, but one that comes to mind is that space and time are malleable components of the universe, changing under certain circumstances, and allowing oddities such as time travel (at least in one direction) possible.

Physics is an inherently abstract subject most of the times, but what I mentioned is proven in repeatedly here on Earth every day. It is a sublime effect which requires measurements of extreme accuracy, but it is here nonetheless.

To that extent, my goal is to illustrate the basics of how space and time work, why they are subject to change under certain circumstances, and how we can accurately measure such changes and apply them to build the GPS on your phone.

In parts:

1.	The differences between Newton’s view of space and time to Einstein’s view of space and time.
2.	Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity, and why space and time act in extraordinary ways under certain circumstances.
3.	How the Global Positioning System (“GPS”) works.
4.	How points 1. and 2. are vital in building a functioning GPS.

(Permanent) Disclaimer: I am no expert on any of the things I talk about. This is true for everything I write on this website. Let this be an eternal disclaimer from here to all other posts that I am but a bewildered monkey with an equally confused and curious mind making sense of things. My goal is not to give an explanation of perfect accurateness as much as sharing phenomenal ideas that may incite some further learning or show you something new.

### 1.	A fruitful battle of titans in their quest for truth - The differences between Newton’s view of space and time to Einstein’s view of space and time.

When you think of space and time, what do you see?

“Space” might mean the skies, the ether, or just everything around us.

 “Time” is… well, time. It is also self-explanatory but difficult to describe concept – they both seem like intangible built-in features of the universe which are clear to us.

If you are anything like me and most other people, you probably see them as two distinct and separate things.

To make sure we are on the same page, however, we first need to arrive at a more useful explanation of space. The best way to get there it is by imagining everything around you disappear (akin a Thanos snap). The device you are reading this on, the floor which you stand on, the scenery around you including all the houses, cars, people, and everything. Take away everything until there is only you in the darkness of space, and nothing else.

(Figure 1.1)

That is space.

But what is it?

One thing which it is not, is empty space.

We know this from quantum mechanics, which is not something we will cover here. But if you are curious, quantum mechanics tells us, among other things, that even in what appears to be empty space, there are countless particles randomly coming in and out of existing at every moment.

In any case, here we have it, space. We also have our first point of disagreement between Newton and Einstein.
Newton viewed space as an unchangeable and absolute structure, whereas Einstein viewed it as something that could be bent and twisted, like a piece of clothing.

To see how these two views are different, we need to understand how both men understood gravity.

**Newton:**

Newton’s understanding of gravity is the one you are most familiar with. Two objects exert an attractive force which depends on their mass and their distance. An object with heavier mass pulls harder than an object with lower mass, and the closest these objects are, the harder the pull.

![NewtonianGravity](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=144qCSQbsDrTw0Z3lJ8iMg6zarIPm2Mbl)
(Figure 1.2)

This is still an extremely precise description of **how** gravity works, and we use Newton’s formulas to this day, but he was not able to tell **why** this gravity exists.

**Einstein:**

Einstein’s understanding of gravity is a lot more counter-intuitive, and unlike Newton, it involves space. Also unlike Newton, it helps us understand the “why” question.

Remember that I told you that space itself could be bent and twisted? The Einstein model predicts that objects weigh-down on the fabric of space itself, like a bowling bowl on top of a mattress, and that the bending of that fabric is what causes gravity.

As I said, picture yourself getting a bowling ball and placing it on the middle of your mattress. You will notice that the weight of the ball pushes down the mattress at the middle, creating a sort of curvature around the bowling ball. If you now tried rolling a tennis ball from one end of the bed to the other, you would notice that its path is altered by the curvature from the bowling ball in the middle.

The universe works in the exact same way.

In the picture below, Earth (the bowling ball) curves space (your mattress) and that curvature of space causes the tennis ball (moon) to alter its path through the mattress (stays in orbit).

(Figure 1.3)

This is a fascinating realization, and although abstract at the moment, highlights the genius realization of Einstein - that space itself is malleable, and that what we think of gravity is fundamentally curvatures along this malleable fabric.

Now that we understand how they both viewed space, we can attend to their perspectives on time. Luckily for us, their disagreement on time is similar to their disagreement on space.

Newton believed that, like space, time was a distinct and absolute entity separate from everything else.

Einstein, on the other hand, refused the notion of absoluteness put forth by Newton to describe space and time. To him, it was impossible to detach the notion of time from the notion of space, because nothing can exist without either.

Imagine your phone for example. If it existed in a physical location, but at no point in time (ever), how would you find it?
Or imagine if your phone existed for all eternity, but in no physical location, how would you find it?

Everything has to exist in space and time for us to be able to perceive it. It thus seems that an intrinsic relationship between space and time must exist. And that is exactly what physicists in the late 19th century started realizing.

Hermann Minkowski, one of the men involved in all this space time business, once said:
“*Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality*".

[1] Minkowski also helped us visualize this relationship between space and time with the Minkowski diagram. We will not go into too much detail on this, but you might see how this helps later.

Keep in mind that this is a 2D visualization of something that is in reality 4D (we have the three dimensions of time we are familiar with from everyday life, plus the one of time). However, it helps illustrate the union between space and time into the so called Spacetime continuum.

### 2. The Dance of the Universe - Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity.

When you are driving down the highway driving at 100 km/h, what does that velocity imply?

If I was at another car next to yours, and was also driving at 100 km/h in the same direction, relative to me you would not be moving at all, while relative to the ground we are both moving at 100 km/h.

If you accelerated and started driving at a 120 km/h, you’d be moving away from me at 20 km/h, while moving away from the ground at 120 km/h.

If there was a car moving at 100 km/h per hour in the opposite direction of ours, we would see it coming towards us at 200 km/h.
So, who is right? Who has the “absolute” speed, which is the true measure of how fast something really is going?

Nobody. All motion is relative.

This is where the name Special Relativity comes in. This theory was an expansion of Newtonian physics to dispel the idea of absolute space and time, and propose that there everything which we perceive is relative. As we shall see, it is because of this theory that we can get our GPS to work.

This idea of relativity, however, is not entirely new. Galileo himself had already understood that motion was relative, but during his time Newton’s mechanics of an absolute space and time still reigned.

It was not until the late 19th century, however, that physicists and mathematicians would revisit Galilean’s relativity to dispel Newton’s absolute time and space. And the fundamental reason of why they were able to do this is the following:

**The speed of light universal constant.**

(More specifically, it is constant through vacuum, but we can ignore that for the time being.)

This may seem like something easy to overlook, but consider what we just saw about relative motion.
As we saw, motion is always relative – a car might be going at 0 km/h, 100 km/h, or even 200 km/h, depending on who is watching it.

Light does not work that way. Light is always, unequivocally, regardless of the circumstances, travelling exactly at 299,792,458 meters per second. Always and infinitely, every single time we measured it, this exact speed comes out.

This is such a fundamental property of the universe, in fact, that it rests as one of the two building blocks of Special Relativity. Without it, Einstein would have never figured any of this out. The other building block of Special Relativity is that the laws of physics are the same for everyone.

And there we have it, the recipe and the ingredients we need for the among strangest things in the entire universe:
A)	The laws of physics being equal for everyone.
B)	The speed of light always being the same.
C)	There is no such thing as an absolute space and absolute time – in fact, the Spacetime continuum is a malleable and relative structure.

So, how do we reach the conclusion that time can pass differently for different people?

We do it by following the postulates mentioned above, and thinking about an (extremely exaggerated) scenario to illustrate the theory.

Let’s imagine we have two brothers, Bob and Alice, which are both at a train station.

Both brothers are carrying with them an interesting clock, a light-clock. This clock is made of two mirrors, one at the bottom, and one way up. The clock ticks everytime a light beam goes from the bottom mirror to the top mirror and back again (a full-trip) as such:

Now, consider that Bob is standing stationary on the waiting area, facing the trains, while Alice is inside the train, moving away from the station at a constant speed. Both of them have their clocks with them.

For Bob, who is sitting still, his clock will tick every second, as expected. However, when he looks at Alice’s clock, he will notice something strange.

Alice is moving, and so is her clock, so the beam of light has to travel a larger distance to reach the top mirror, and it also has to travel a larger distance to reach the bottom mirror. In other words, the light beam takes longer to make a full-round trip.

[gif]

Now, the crucial and most fundamental part of all of this is that the speed of light is the exact same for Bob and Alice.
As you might recall, distance = speed * time.

In our case, then, we know from what we have just seen that Alice’s light beam, from Bob’s perspective, had a larger distance to travel then his own clock. However, the speed of both light beams is constant is constant, and so the only variable that can change is time.

That must have meant that Alice’s clock took longer to do a full trip, meaning that time for Alice has slowed down relative to Bob.
This is a crazy conclusion. The distance was longer, and the speed of light is fixed, so only time could be changed. There is no way to increase or decrease the speed of light, so spacetime itself has altered to protect the fact that the speed of light is constant. Remember how we mentioned that spacetime was a malleable fabric, with nothing absolute about it? This is how it can be bent and twisted, to preserve its own sanity.

[2 Lorentz transformation, gamma, and proof]

The name of these relative differences in time is called Time Dilation, and it is a very real effect. It is not, however, the only weird thing about Special Relativity. One of its conclusions also states moving observers not only have their clocks slow down, but they also appear to be contracted in length relative to someone observing them.

### 3. The Basics of How GPS works.

GPS, or NAVSTAR Global Positioning System, is a collection of US-made satellites orbiting our planet. The GPS was initially a military initiative, but it has spread over civilian life ubiquitously. Other countries also have their own “GPS” networks:

Russia – Glonass

European Union – Galileo

China – Beidou 2

And more.

In any case, we will be referring to GPS from now on.

How does it work?

At every given moment, your phone is being bombarded with signals from the GPS satellites in orbit.

These signals travel at the speed of light, and they carry with them information about the position of the satellites. They travel in all directions from the satellite, like a circle.

When you open the GPS application on your phone, the software does something called Trilateration (which I previously confused with triangulation, which is a measure of angles, not distance like Trilateration).

Trilateration means combining received signals from at least three different sources, and pinpointing an intersection point between such signals.

For example, if one satellite broadcasts their signals and your phone picks it up, your phone won’t know exactly where it is, because it could be anywhere within the circle signal from the satellite. It knows this because when it receives the signal, it can calculate the time it took to reach your phone, and infer a circle as such:

![satellite1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1MUaZ0M0YwMn4d1S2D9P-H4QJFnVNUV8R)
[Figure 1.6]

If you keep repeating the process, however, you can draw an intersection between different signals to pick up your exact location, since they all converge to a very accurate position, as demonstrated in the picture below.

![satellite4](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Nt2pnaB3tbotvsmkjAcUwx8wmQMbj7IE)
[Figure 1.7]

In short, this is how your phone is able to tell you where you are in the planet.
However, to yield such extremely accurate measurements, the clocks from our phones and the satellites need to be synchronized. Because light travels so fast (300 million meters per second) even extremely small changes in their clocks would account for vast differences in distance, which would give you a totally wrong position. This is exactly where the relativity that we saw comes into play.

### 4.	Why GPS needs Special Relativity.
I lied.

The truth is, time dilation does not occur only for moving objects. It is also happening to you and me right now, even when we are standing still.

Remember that I told you spacetime is malleable because large objects like our planet weigh down on its fabric and cause it to bend?

It turns out that this bending also causes time dilation. It so happens, in fact, that the larger the gravity of an object, the higher the time dilation factor.

If you have ever seen Interstellar this is exactly what happens when they go into the planet that is near the black hole. A black hole is an object of such astounding gravity that the curvature of space around it is ridiculously extreme, and so when they landed on that planet, one hour for them there was equivalent to seven years on Earth.

This gravitational effect on spacetime was included in Einstein’s second theory of relativity, the General Theory of relativity, which is a whole new beast we will leave alone for now.

In any case then, we know that objects moving experience time more slowly, and we also know that objects being affected by gravity also experience time more slowly.

The satellites are orbiting at an average speed of around 4 km/s. If we plug this our the Lorentz factor calculation, we get a relative difference in time of about 7 microseconds per day, meaning that the satellites clock’s run slower by this amount.

On gravity, however, we appear to have our clocks running more slowly since the gravitational forces are larger for objects closer to the center of mass. The satellites are at about 20km from ground. This difference is about 45 microseconds a day, and so in total, our clocks appear to be running slower by about 38 microseconds a day in comparison to the satellites.

If left unaccounted for, this difference would yield an imprecision of C (the speed of light) * 38 microseconds per day, which is equivalent to around 11 km per day. Imagine picking up your GPS and only knowing the degree of accuracy of your position by 11 km instead of the usual 15 meters.

The people who build the satellites corrected for this relativistic effects by altering the frequency at which the satellites clock runs, namely making it slower to match Earth’s clocks. If you are curious, the frequency of the satellite clocks before launch is 10.22999999543 MHz., while ours on Earth are 12.3 MHz. It is this tiny difference that keeps guiding us home everyday, and this is all thanks to one very brilliant man.

I already wrote an entire post on ignorance, trust, and gratitude, but I’d like to re-emphasize that theme here one more time.
When you open the GPS on your phone and it guides you to where you want to go, you might not notice it, but underneath it everything that I just told you goes on under the hood. Not only that, think about the engineering behind it, the infrastructure on ground to ensure that all these satellites are in orbit, launching those satellites in orbit, managing them efficiently and making sure they are all running smoothly, and adjusting for the weirdness of the universe itself, all at the click of a button that we don’t even notice it.

I can’t think of anything else to say but thank you.
