Lessons of history moral changes
Jp quote stumbling towards kingdom of god.

When I was a kid, my mom gave me a very special book called “Parece mas não é”.
In Portuguese, “Parece mas não é” translates to something like “Looks like it, but it is not it”, as in “Looks like a duck, but it is not a duck” or “Looks like a house, but it is not a house”.  
This book consists mainly of cartoonish drawings; in fact, there are almost no words. These drawings look like something you see in everyday life. For instance, one of the drawings could be a snapshot of a busy street – it has cars, streetlights, buildings, etc – but when you look closely at some of these things, you start to notice that they look like cars, streetlights, buildings, etc, but they are not cars, streetlights, buildings, etc. For example, the cars’ wheels are coins, the streetlights bodies are pens, the building’s roof is made of cards, etc.
But not everything is necessarily made from random objects, and that is the fun of the book – it is up to you to figure out what Parece mas não é!
However, the pictures are very well-drawn, and things are beautifully disguised so that it is not obvious to know what is and what is not. As a kid, my primary motivation was to find out all the things that should not be there. But thinking about this book today makes me think of something different.
The idea that it gives me is that we, generally, only see the world in one way – and that is how we normally see it in our everyday lives. When we walk down the street, we don’t think too much about the cars, the streetlights, and the buildings – they are what they are. We see, we hear, and we feel everything around us. We all have histories, and we all have notions of why things are the way they are. Your reality is yours, but is that the only way of viewing it?
Or, if we looked closely (as in the book), could we start to notice things that look like, but are not? What might we find if we do learn how to look at things differently? Could we benefit from looking at things in different ways?
I sincerely believe there is great benefit from looking through these questions, and without further ado, I would like to tell you about alternative ways of viewing the world as some people currently see it, or, the way I see something which Parece mas não é.
In specific, I want to outline the way I view four fundamental parts of our reality – the universe, our planet, our communities, and ourselves – and how we might view each single one of these parts differently.  

1 – We are the universe
Imagine you just came home from the shopping mall with a Star Wars themed set of LEGO toys. You go into the living room, clean the floor, open the box, and stare at all the incredible things you can build – the Death Star, the Millennium Falcon, Darth Vader’s castle, Jedi, stormtroopers, all that good stuff.
You spend some time working on it, but finally everything is done. All the little LEGO pieces have been assembled in the right way, and you have built a beautiful Star Wars scene in your living room!
Suppose now that you were asked the question: “How different is each LEGO toy from the other?”. For instance, how different is the Death Star from the Millennium Falcon, or how different is Luke Skywalker from Darth Vader?”.
While the “how different” part can be more subjective, I believe there are two objective definitions to include in one’s answer to that question.
The first is that the fundamental component of each LEGO toy is the exact same – they are all made of the little LEGO building blocks that we love to step on so much. These little blocks might be different in color, shape, or size, but they are all little building blocks nonetheless (and it seems that the pain they inflict upon being stepped on is the same!).
The second objective definition is that the only reason why any two toys are different is because the little building blocks making them were different. For instance, the little building blocks making up the Death Star are in different size and color than the ones making the Millennium Falcon. Further, they are also arranged in different shapes – the Death Star is a sphere while the Millennium Falcon is more like a triangle. But, if we were to get the same set of little building blocks, of the same color, of the same size, and arrange them in the exact same way, then we would have two exactly equal LEGO toys.
After a while, you are done with all this LEGO business and you go in the kitchen to make a sandwich. You open the drawer, get the bread out, put some peanut butter and jelly on it, and eat it. Suppose now that you were asked that same question, but under a different context: “How different are you from the bread you just ate?”.
Without thinking too much about it, most of us would probably say “We are completely different – there is nothing between me and this bread. I am a human and this is a piece of bread”. This seems obvious to all of us, and I don’t think anyone even spends time thinking about this while eating bread!
But what if what looked like two completely separate things, were not that separate?
At some level, that bread you ate it is made of countless molecules bundled together, such as its proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and other nutrients and minerals. These molecules are also made of countless compounds made up of the most fundamental building blocks of everything: atoms.
Now, atoms are an incredibly abstract part of our lives. Together they make up everything that has ever existed and that will ever exist, but you have never even seen one of them! They are, in a sense, equally as mysterious as the skies but in the opposite direction, and make us stand humbly in the middle of things much beyond ourselves.
Anyway, I do not think that the little LEGO building blocks are any different (in their functionality) than atoms. Atoms also come in different shapes, sizes, colors, and they can be arranged in many different ways [1].
For instance, that bread you ate is mostly made up of Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and some other atoms. Much like the LEGO building blocks, each of those atoms was arranged in a specific way, so that all together they made up a piece of bread. Had these atoms been re-arranged differently, they could have been pasta or rice for example.
There is something else which is made up of Oxygen, Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and some other atoms [2], and that is you. It is also every single one of the hundred billion people that lived on this planet.
There are more building blocks though, and they are in the clothes, cars, water, rocks, rockets, whales, apples, movies, dictionaries, computers, air, fire, stars, planets, and everything else that exists. We are all, without a doubt, made of the exact same type of little building blocks, and the only reason why anything is different from anything is because these building blocks were arranged differently.
This is an extremely abstract but beautiful idea – that everything is fundamentally the same. Deep down, the difference between you and the Sun is only as big as the difference between any two LEGO toys.
To me, this notion of fundamental unity is enough to dispel many of the ghosts which have haunted, and still haunt, our world to this day. Think about the misery, suffering, and pain brought onto other humans in the name of racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, and all the countless other forms of discrimination that have existed. How could one truly stand firm behind any of such beliefs given the fact we are all the same? How can we accept to judge someone in such ways when the only reason we are different is because our building blocks were arranged in different ways?
This is a farfetched idea – these unparalleled griefs will not cease to exist from one day to another, even if we acknowledged these truths. However, I do firmly believe there is some great benefit in seeing how we may look different from one another, but how we really are the same.
Not only are we the same, but the story of how we came to be is so homogeneous and unsettling that any sort of leftovers of prejudice are brought to the light of truth. I plan on writing separately about this, but the core idea is this:
Our building blocks came from stars, like our Sun. Throughout unfathomable time spans (billions of years) stars go through their lives, creating different types of atoms in the process. At the end of their lives, all these different atoms are released in space through an unparalleled explosion called a supernova. The leftovers from this explosion are gathered through the gravitational forces between each other, and they end up building new things, like a planet for example. And in this planet, and in you, and in everything, all these building blocks are present, the building blocks which were created in the furnace inside the heart of stars.
As Carl Sagan said “The Cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself”.
























2 – A hundred monkeys on a wooden raft in an infinite ocean
I enjoy reading about history because it makes me feel extremely grateful, conscious, and realistic. The books of history contain the best and the worst of humanity, and understanding our nature better can create a useful inner compass.
But sometimes when I study about history I get extraordinarily upset, because what I read seems to be so brutal that an overwhelming sensation of grief looms in my heart.
I am talking about the nefarious atrocities committed which are so dark, grotesque, and unspeakable that one could never really talk about it – we can only refer to the ghost of that hell on earth. For instance, the Atlantic slave trade, the Witch Hunts, the Rape of Nanking, the Holocaust, the Gulags, the Genocides, the Wars, the Inquisitions, and all the other monstrosities that have happened, and still happen, to this day. [Quote]
Why did we, and why do we still, do these things to each other?
I sincerely believe that the answer is because of ignorance.
We were incapable of using reason, truth, and dialogue to reach the conclusions about what is just, and should be the best course of action for everyone. Instead, too much power was given to people with too much unwillingness to reason, and the result was death. We were unable to see ourselves for what we really are, and we let the shadows of hatred, intolerance, ignorance, and deception blind us.
The light to dispel these shadows, I believe, is truth. Truth is the most important thing we can speak of. It is the fundamental component of a just and reasonable existence, because it keeps away the plagues that stem from untruth. Dr. Jordan Peterson explained this better than I possibly could:
“Life is suffering. Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated. Truth is the handmaiden of love. Dialogue is the pathway to truth. Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn. To learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and small.
So, speech must be untrammeled, so that dialogue can take place; so that we can all humbly learn, so that truth can serve love, so that suffering can be ameliorated, so that we can all stumble forward, so to speak, towards the kingdom of God.”
This is without a doubt a much deeper subject; but my point is that we can be better, all of us, if we can speak and live according to the truth.
So how can we go from looking at each other the way that currently we do, to understanding how we really are? And how could we use this realization to prevent the unspeakable atrocities from happening again?
Imagine you wake up in a huge wooden raft in the middle of the ocean. There are other 99 people in this raft. None of you know where you came from, or where you are going – you all woke up in this raft equally as confused. There is no land in sight, only water in every direction.
Now, what could these people do? It is a strange circumstance after all.
There are fundamentally two different ways to manage this situation:
1) People in the raft cooperate to reach a common goal for everyone – finding land as fast as possible. Now, the means of reaching that goal may vary, but in this case, everyone agrees that this is a very strange circumstance, and they all agree to keep going north. The people in the raft divide themselves into their best capabilities, and they all work towards a common goal in an efficient manner.
2) People in the raft do not cooperate to reach a common goal for everyone – there is an inability to reason, enhance efficiency, and work together. Some individuals with strong beliefs are unable to have a truthful dialogue, and soon enough sections of people are created, with the “Southerners”, “Westerners”, “Easterners”, and “Northerners” continuously bickering with each other about which direction to go. The sections sabotage, exploit, and fight each other – at the end of the day, the different sections try going in the different directions, and the raft does not go anywhere.
It seems to me unequivocally clear that we too are doing a type 2 management of our raft, the Earth. We are quite literally flying through a possibly infinite space at this very moment, without any particular direction, without knowing where we came from, and without knowing where we are going.
We have divided ourselves in sections, and we are also unable to agree on how to best manage our raft. We let the shadows of untruth blind us from the undoubted truth that we are all fundamentally the same, and that we all could be doing better if we cooperated. People are not willing to admit that they are wrong, that their beliefs may cause unnecessary pain. There is little mutual agreement about where we should go – our sections are simply unable to cooperate. We deliberately choose to beat on each other rather than agreeing that we are all on the same raft, and that we could be doing better.
Imagine, for instance, on that gigantic wooden raft, that people in the different sections started cutting down the wood on the edges so that they could build weapons to “protect” themselves, instead of using that wood to build shelter for everyone. Spears to attack each other, and no protection from the rain and cold – that’s what they chose.
Do we not do the exact same thing with our planet? How many wars, deaths, suffering, and pain have been brought forth in the name of resources, finite resources, so that we could feed our section? What could we have done with these resources if we weren’t so preoccupied with “protecting” ourselves from each other?
Per year the world spends US$1.8 trillion in military spending. I am not going to even suggest a complete eradication of military spending, because that is farfetched even for this already farfetched subject, but imagine we started acting in cooperation and saved 20% of this budget. [Source on budget, 3]
That is equivalent to US$360 billion per year – enough to solve so many of the unnecessary burdens we deal with today. Think of the improvements on global education, healthcare, infrastructure, and general quality of life if we could manage this specific amount of money – which would be only the first baby step in long road. We could even reshape the planet we have been selfishly squandering for so long.
What is stopping us?
The way we look at things. We are not really seeing that we are all on a gigantic raft. We are not  really seeing that we all the made of the same things, coming from the same place, and going to the same place.
We keep fighting each other, and all that geopolitical bullshit, yadayadayada. At the end of the day we are all the same idiot monkeys on this pebble in space and we would rather keep beating each other up and dreaming about heaven after life than make heaven here itself.
It will take a long time, if ever, before this level of cooperation is reached. In the meantime, individuals like you and me might benefit from seeing this as they really are, so that we can treat each other better in our local communities, and build up from there.





















3 – The age of illusion
It is easy to get lost today.
Across all the layers of reality which we are exploring, the fundamental mismatch between what looks like something, and what really is something is most visibly clear at the community level. I believe this mismatch reached such proportions due to the rise of technology which has in some respects atomized the experience of being a human.
Would you like to eat almost anything from almost anywhere? Have it delivered to your house within a few minutes by clicking on your phone a few times!
Would you like to know what movie to watch? Get thousands of reviews on thousands of movies by clicking on your phone a few times!
Would you like to have sex with someone? Well, why bother knowing the person? Just swipe right, swipe right, and swipe right, until the clicks connect and the two of you are locked in an empty dance through the ether!
Desire, click, instant gratification. Desire, click, instant gratification. Desire, click, instant gratification. The tasks of everyday life are being substituted by faceless processes which save us time but rob us of meaning. Our brain’s dopamine receptors are being manipulated in the same way they would as if we were addicts. [source] Not having Wi-Fi, not getting enough likes on a picture, not finding the right angle for a selfie – modern struggles which release cortisol in our brains almost as if they were really that bad.l
It appears, to me at least, that the powers of technology are being used by the individual in a detrimental manner in the long run. The promise of unity that came from the inevitable connection brought forth by the internet has in many ways isolated us.
It genuinely pains me to walk into restaurants nowadays. Often I will find groups of people with their individual members looking down at their phones. Often I will find groups of people all taking pictures and videos of their food as soon as it arrives, not carrying about how they really feel about what’s going on, but instead being solely focused on what it will look like to other people.
It is no surprise to me, then, to hear the news that among the most developed nations in the world, such as the United States, suicide-rates and opioids addiction are at all time highs. [source].
Do we really believe that the modern world has nothing to do with this crisis of emptiness? How could it not?
It has never been easier for one to be sucked in a vortex of illusions – all it takes is opening up your choice of social media and browse through the beautiful, meaningful, and happy lives of millions of people around the world.
We pamper ourselves for our pictures, we edit them, we think of funny things to say, and we are all trying to capture that attention, that feeling of belonging, the apparent rope through the vortex of illusion. It is a natural instinct for a human to want to belong, to be recognized – but we have taken this impulse to the limit, and we have done it through the infinite enhancement of social media, for one. Some of us, many of us, are much more concerned about what people will say of us than what we want. We pose for them, but the naked truth stares us blankly in the face.
At the end of the day, the irony is that everyone behind the screen is also a human, also a beautifully mysterious being who will unequivocally suffer, fear, stumble, and face the intrinsic hardships of life.
Yet, that is not what it looks like nowadays, because we only see ourselves through filters.
Make no mistake about It I am part of it too. Internet has helped me in some ways to keep connected to my friends which I would have lost otherwise. My concern is that this wave of technology is atomizing us, ridding us of meaning which is an incredibly dangerous pit to fall in given the mysteries of reality, and to me, it looks like we live in this society where everyone is connect, social media, doing great, but in truth we are all humble monkeys floating through space not knowing shit from shit and we all need each other more than ever, to figure out the best path for us, but we don’t get there by talking to each other tru text messages.
Is it hard to see that we are all the same building blocks in slightlfy differeting arrangements floating on this huge raft adrift nowhere and that we do have a craving to belong and to care for each other, but we would rather hide ourselves and pretend to be people we want to be?















4 – Dichotomies of being
What does this all mean?
Don’t take anything for granted, always look at things at different ways. How could it be better? What can you do?

Think deeply about the simple things.
1 ) Stardust, the illusion of self, and the stupidity of racism/xenophobia/etc.
Something which I think often about is the dichotomy of being a human. In other words, contrasting observations we can make simply by thinking. It is a strange thing to notice two opposite observations which are simultaneously true.
There are many of such dichotomies, but one I became particularly interested in is the sense of “self” amidst what seems to be one thing.
2 ) Cost of cooperation, how we keep on fighting each other when really we should be thinking about all of us – carrignton event, argentina blackout, how we think of each other as enemies, forces to compete with, when in reality collaboration would make everyone better off.
3) Emotions, social media, the truth about our fragility, the fact that we are so depedant on each other, and where that leaves our humility, why can’t we learn from each other?

4) Dichotomy of being.










Note – a lot of these ideas are not my discoveries.
[1] There is certainly a much more minute description of an atom. However, it is extremely complicated to describe how their properties behave in a coherent manner, and frankly that is beyond my scope at the moment. My main point was that there are thousands of different atoms which can be quite different from one another in many, many different ways.
