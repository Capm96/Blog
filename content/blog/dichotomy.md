---- DRAFT ----
When I was a kid, my mom gave me a very special book called “Parece mas não é”.
In Portuguese, “Parece mas não é” translates to something like “Looks like it, but it is not it”, as in “Looks like a duck, but it is not a duck” or “Looks like a house, but it is not a house”.  
This book consists mainly of cartoonish drawings; in fact, there are almost no words. These drawings look like something you see in everyday life. For instance, one of the drawings could be a snapshot of a busy street – it has cars, streetlights, buildings, etc – but when you look closely at some of these things, you start to notice that they look like cars, streetlights, buildings, etc, but they are not cars, streetlights, buildings, etc. For example, the cars’ wheels are coins, the streetlights are pens, the buildings are made of cards, etc.
But not everything is necessarily made out of random objects, and that is the fun of the book – it is up to you to figure out what Parece mas não é! However, the pictures are very well-drawn, and things are beautifully disguised so that it is not obvious to know what is and what is not.
As a kid, my primary motivation was to find out all the things that should not be there. But thinking about this book today makes me think of something different.
The idea that it gives me is that we, generally, only see the world in one way – and that is how we normally see it in our everyday lives. When we walk down the street, we don’t think too much about the cars, the streetlights, and the buildings – they are what they are. We see, we hear, and we feel everything around us. We all have histories, and we all have notions of why things are the way they are. Your reality is yours, but is that the only way of viewing it?
Or, if we looked closely (as in the book), could we start to notice things that look like, but are not? Further, what might happen if we do learn how to look at things differently?
I sincerely believe there is great benefit in exploring these questions, and I would like to tell you about alternative ways of viewing the world, or, the way I see some things which Parece mas não é. In specific, I want to outline the way I view four fundamental parts of reality – the universe, our planet, our communities, and ourselves – what we can find by looking at these parts under this different perspective.








1 – You, the universe, and LEGO
Imagine you just came home from a shopping mall with a Star Wars themed set of LEGO toys. You go into the living room, clean the floor, open the box, and stare at all the incredible things you can build – the Death Star, the Millennium Falcon, Darth Vader’s castle, Jedi, stormtroopers, all that good stuff.
You spend some time working on it, but finally everything is done. All the little LEGO pieces have been assembled in the right way, and you have built a beautiful Star Wars scene in your living room!
Suppose now that you were asked the question: “How different is each LEGO toy from the other?” For instance, how different is the Death Star from the Millennium Falcon, or how different is Luke Skywalker from Darth Vader?”.
While the “how different” part can be more subjective, I believe there are two objective definitions to include in one’s answer to that question, independent of the subjective part.
The first is that the fundamental component of each LEGO toy is the exact same – they are all made of the little LEGO building blocks that we love to step on so much. These little blocks might be different in color, shape, or size, but they are all little building blocks nonetheless (and it seems that the pain they inflict upon being stepped on is the same!).
The second objective definition is that the only reason why any two toys are different is because the little building blocks making them were different. For instance, the little building blocks making up the Death Star are in different size and color than the ones making the Millennium Falcon. Further, they are also arranged in different shapes – the Death Star is a sphere while the Millennium Falcon is more like a triangle. But, if we were to get the same set of little building blocks, of the same color, of the same size, and arrange them in the exact same way, then we would have two exactly equal LEGO toys.
So, while you may have a different opinion on how different one toy might be from another, we could agree that they are made of the same building blocks, and the reason why they are different is because those building blocks were arranged differently.
After a while, you are done with all this LEGO business and you go in the kitchen to make a sandwich. You open the drawer, get the bread out, put some peanut butter and jelly on it, and eat it. Suppose now that you were asked that same question, but under a different context: “How different are you from the bread you just ate?”.
Without thinking too much about it, most of us would probably say “We are completely different – there is nothing between me and this bread. I am a human and this is a piece of bread”. This seems obvious to all of us, and I don’t think anyone even spends time thinking about this while eating bread!
But what if what looked like two separate things, were not that separate?
At some level, that bread you ate it is made of countless molecules bundled together, such as its proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and other nutrients and minerals. These molecules are also made of countless compounds made up of the most fundamental building blocks of everything: atoms.
Now, atoms are an incredibly abstract part of our lives. Together they make up everything that has ever existed and that will ever exist, but you have never even seen one of them! They are, in a sense, equally as mysterious as the skies (but in the opposite direction) and make us stand humbly in the middle of things much beyond ourselves.
Anyway, I do not think that the little LEGO building blocks are any different (in their functionality) than atoms. Atoms also come in different shapes, sizes, colors, and they can be arranged in many ways to build all sorts of things. [1]
For instance, that bread you ate is mostly made up of Carbon, Oxygen, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and some other atoms. All these atoms were arranged in a specific way, so that all together they made up a piece of bread. Had these atoms been re-arranged differently, they could have been pasta or rice for example!
There is something else which is made up of Oxygen, Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and some other atoms, and that is you. [2]
It is also every single one of the hundred billion people that have ever lived on this planet. Everyone that you know and everyone that you have ever heard about is without a doubt made of the same exact type of little building blocks. Certainly, people are different for a variety of reasons (genetics, environment, random events) but fundamentally we are all made of the same thing.
There are more building blocks though, and they make up everything. They are in the clothes, cars, water, rocks, rockets, whales, apples, movies, dictionaries, computers, air, fire, stars, planets, and everything else that exists.
We are all part of a gigantic LEGO set, called the universe, and everything in it is made of the exact same building blocks – just arranged in different ways. Deep down, your answer to that question of “How different is the Death Star toy from the Millennium Falcon toy” is equivalent to “How different am I from a piece of bread” or “How different am I from the Sun”, in my perspective.
To me, this notion of a fundamental unity is enough to dispel many of the ghosts which have haunted, and still haunt, our world to this day. Think about the misery, suffering, and pain brought onto other humans in the name of racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, and all the countless other forms of discrimination that have existed. How could one truly stand firm behind any of such beliefs given the fact we are all the same? How can we accept to judge someone in such ways when the only reason we are different is because our building blocks were arranged in different ways, and we happened to be born on different places in this gigantic LEGO set?
Granted, this is a farfetched idea – these unparalleled griefs will not cease to exist from one day to another, even if we acknowledged these truths. However, I do firmly believe there is some great benefit in recognizing that although we may look different from one another, we really are the same.
Your personal beliefs, personality traits, ambitions, hair color, favorite food – all these traits are the way they are because you were born in “X” place at “Y” time with “Z” circumstances happening in your life (childhood, family, culture, etc). If we were able to strip ourselves one atom at a time, we would eventually find that we are as equal as any other human being who has ever lived.
As a side note, I think it is important to consider the implications of this, because they can be easily misrepresented. Understanding that we are fundamentally the same does not change anything – it may simply act as a catalyst for empathy, humility, and connection between each other. And I do not mean this in a spiritual “woo-woo” type of way, I mean: “Hey, this person I am yelling at during traffic is exactly like me – we came from the exact same place and we are only different because of our histories” and this might lead one to realizing that maybe wasting energy yelling at each other is not so helpful – we are all just humans. Lastly, it does not also alleviate guilt from people who impose suffering on other people despite us being fundamentally the same. Stalin’s actions are no less reprehensible and should not be discarded simply because of our atomic similarities.
Finally, and I will not spend too much time here because it is a fantastic story of its own, the way how all these building blocks came to be is a fascinating one. Not only are we the same, but the reason why we got to be the same is so profound that it brings to me an even greater sense of humility and unity.
Our building blocks came from stars, like our Sun. Our sun is a gargantuan ball of gas, mostly hydrogen, which is so hot and dense that at its core, the hydrogen atoms fuse with each other to make new, heavier atoms. The energy that is released in this process is the same one that feeds the plants which feed the planet.
Throughout unfathomable time spans (billions of years) stars go through their lives, creating many different types of atoms. At the end of their lives, all these different atoms are released in space through an unparalleled explosion called a supernova. The leftovers from this explosion are attracted to each other through gravity, and they end up building new things, like a planet for example. And in this planet, and in you, and in everything, all these building blocks are present, the building blocks which were created in the furnace inside the heart of stars.
In the end then, everything that exists was once made in the heart of stars. One gigantic LEGO set spilled across the skies from an impossibly huge explosion. Some of it became rocks, some it became the oceans, and some of it became life on earth, and here I am, a part of all of this, telling you that we are all on the same set. As Carl Sagan said “The Cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself”.
You see, things might look like they are different, but they really are not that different at all

2 – A hundred monkeys on a wooden raft in an infinite ocean
I enjoy reading about history because it makes me feel quite grateful for being alive today. The books of history contain the best and the worst of humanity, and understanding our nature better can create a useful inner compass of realism and reason.
But sometimes when I study about history I get extraordinarily upset, because what I read seems to be so brutal that an overwhelming sensation of grief looms in my heart.
I am talking about the nefarious atrocities committed which are so dark, grotesque, and unspeakable that one could never really talk about it – we can only refer to the ghost of that hell on earth. For instance, the Atlantic slave trade, the Witch Hunts, the Holocaust, the Gulags, the Genocides, the Wars, the Inquisitions, and all the other monstrosities that have happened, and still happen, to this day.
This is an excerpt from Iris Chang’s book The Rape of Nanking, which talks about the Japanese invasion of mainland China in 1937.
“ On December 13, 1937, thirty Japanese soldiers came to the Chinese home at 5 Hsing Lu Kao in the southeastern part of Nanking. They killed the landlord when he opened the door, and then Mr. Hsia, a tenant who had fallen to his knees to beg them not to kill anyone else. When the landlord’s wife asked why they murdered her husband, they shot her dead. The Japanese then dragged Mrs. Hsia from under a table in the guest hall where she had tried to hide with her one-year-old baby. They stripped her, raped her, then bayoneted her in the chest when they were finished. The soldiers thrust a perfume bottle in her vagina and also killed the baby by bayonet. Then they went into the next room, where they found Mrs. Hsia’s parents and two teenage daughters. The grandmother, who tried to protect the girls from rape, was shot by revolver; the grandfather clasped the body of his wife and was killed immediately.
The soldiers then stripped the girls and took turns raping them: the sixteen-year-old by two or three men, the fourteen-year-old by three. The Japanese not only stabbed the older girl to death after raping her but rammed a bamboo cane into her vagina. The younger one was simply bayoneted and “spared the horrible treatment meted out to her sister and mother,” a foreigner later wrote of the scene. The soldiers also bayoneted another sister, aged eight, when she hid with her four-year-old sister under the blankets of a bed. The four-year-old remained under the blankets so long she nearly suffocated. She was to endure brain damage for the rest of her life from the lack of oxygen. “

Needless to say, such horror exists. It has existed, and it can exist for very long if we do not learn to do otherwise. Why did we, and why do we still, do these things to each other?

The answer is terribly complicated and much beyond my scope of analysis, but I sincerely believe that fundamental underlying cause is ignorance.

We were incapable of using reason, truth, and dialogue to reach the conclusions about what is just, and should be the best course of action for everyone. Instead, too much power was given to people with too much unwillingness to reason, and the result was death. We were unable to see ourselves for what we really are, and we let the shadows of hatred, intolerance, ignorance, and deception blind us.
The light to dispel these shadows, I believe, is truth. Truth is the most important thing we can speak of. It is the fundamental component of a just and reasonable existence, because it keeps away the plagues that stem from untruth. Dr. Jordan Peterson explained this better than I possibly could:
“Life is suffering. Love is the desire to see unnecessary suffering ameliorated. Truth is the handmaiden of love. Dialogue is the pathway to truth. Humility is recognition of personal insufficiency and the willingness to learn. To learn is to die voluntarily and be born again, in great ways and small.
So, speech must be untrammeled, so that dialogue can take place; so that we can all humbly learn, so that truth can serve love, so that suffering can be ameliorated, so that we can all stumble forward, so to speak, towards the kingdom of God.”
This is without a doubt a much deeper subject; but my point is that we can be better, all of us, if we can speak and live according to the truth.
So how can we go from just looking at each other, to understanding how we truly are?
Imagine you wake up in a huge wooden raft in the middle of the ocean. There are other 99 people in this raft. None of you know where you came from, or where you are going – you all woke up in this raft equally as confused. There is no land in sight, only water in every direction.
Now, what could these people do? It is a strange circumstance after all.
There are fundamentally two different ways to manage this situation:
1) People in the raft cooperate to reach a common goal for everyone – finding land as fast as possible. Now, the means of reaching that goal may vary, but in this case, everyone agrees that this is a very strange circumstance, and they all agree to keep going north. The people in the raft divide themselves into their best capabilities, and they all work towards a common goal in an efficient manner.
2) People in the raft do not cooperate to reach a common goal for everyone – there is an inability to reason, enhance efficiency, and work together. Some individuals with strong beliefs are unable to have a truthful dialogue, and soon enough sections of people are created, with the “Southerners”, “Westerners”, “Easterners”, and “Northerners” continuously bickering with each other about which direction to go. The sections sabotage, exploit, and fight each other – at the end of the day, the different sections try going in the different directions, and the raft does not go anywhere.
It seems to me unequivocally clear that we too are doing a type 2 management of our raft, the Earth. We are quite literally flying through a possibly infinite space at this very moment, without knowing where we came from, and without knowing where we are going.
We have divided ourselves in sections, and we are also unable to agree on how to best manage our raft. We let the shadows of untruth blind us from the actual truth that we are all fundamentally the same, and that we all could be doing better if we cooperated. People are not willing to admit that they are wrong, that their beliefs may cause unnecessary pain. There is little mutual agreement about where we should go – our sections are simply unable to cooperate. We deliberately choose to beat on each other rather than agreeing that we are all on the same raft, and that we could be doing better.
Imagine, for instance, on that gigantic wooden raft, that people in the different sections started cutting down the wood on the edges so that they could build weapons to “protect” themselves, instead of using that wood to build shelter for everyone. Spears to attack each other, and no protection from the rain and cold – that’s what they chose.
Do we not do the exact same thing with our planet? How many wars, deaths, suffering, and pain have been brought forth in the name of resources, finite resources, so that we could feed our section? What could we have done with these resources if we weren’t so preoccupied with “protecting” ourselves from each other?
Per year the world spends US$1.8 trillion in military spending. I am not going to even suggest a complete eradication of military spending, because that is farfetched even for this already farfetched subject, but imagine we started acting in cooperation and saved 20% of this budget. [Source on budget, 3]
That is equivalent to US$360 billion per year – enough to solve so many of the unnecessary burdens we deal with today. Think of the improvements on global education, healthcare, infrastructure, and general quality of life if we could manage this specific amount of money – which would be only the first baby step in long road. We could even reshape the planet we have been selfishly squandering for so long.
What is stopping us?
A lot – this is an immensely complicated question. But for one, the way we look at things. We are not really seeing that we are all on a gigantic raft. We are not  really seeing that we all made of the same things, coming from the same place, and going to the same place.
We keep on fighting with each other, we have a fragile international geopolitical system, our leaders can’t cooperate, our nations are quite divided, and the truth stays out of the stage. It is always “What I believe” vs “What you believe” instead of “What the hell actually is true”.
If you look at it closely, you will see that we really are stupid monkeys floating on a small planet in the middle of a great void and that we are all much more alike than apart, and that maybe it would be a good idea to stop praying to heaven and acting poorly and instead focused on building heaven for everyone here.
It will take a long time, if ever, before this level of cooperation is reached. In the meantime, individuals like you and me might benefit from seeing this as they really are, so that we can treat each other better in our local communities, and build up from there.


























3 – Dichotomies of being
The Lessons of History is a book written by Will Durant and Ariel Durant in 1968. In it, the two historians summarize important trends throughout human history.
One chapter which opened my eyes to something I had not previously thought about is called “Morals and History”. In it, the authors make an interesting claim that a set of morals is entirely dependent upon where a society is in time and place.  
“Moral codes differ because they adjust themselves to historical and environmental conditions. If we divide economic history into three stages—hunting, agriculture, industry—we may expect that the moral code of one stage will be changed in the next. In the hunting stage a man had to be ready to chase and fight and kill. When he had caught his prey he ate to the cubic capacity of his stomach, being uncertain when he might eat again […] Presumably the death rate in men—so often risking their lives in the hunt—was higher than in women; some men had to take several women, and every man was expected to help women to frequent pregnancy. Pugnacity, brutality, greed, and sexual readiness were advantages in the struggle for existence. Probably every vice was once a virtue—i.e., a quality making for the survival of the individual, the family, or the group. Man’s sins may be the relics of his rise rather than the stigmata of his fall. […]”
Besides agreeing with them, I was also reminded that this book was written in 1968, and that we may perhaps have reached the fourth age: the information age. If so, what set of new morals can we derive from this new age?
This is a very interesting question, and one that I cannot claim to have an incredible answer to, but I will try my best and show you how that is connected to the topic of Parece mas não é.
In my opinion, the fundamental change required in our moral code the one that relates to how we deal with all the information in this information age. How can we, amidst the infinite amount of content out there, navigate through and make the best use out of it?
It seems clear to me that we have reached an unprecedented point in technological history. Among many other fascinating feats, we have a magical device that contains the entire human knowledge at our fingertips. Not only that, this device has also increased our communication to unprecedented levels, and it has helped us in many tasks of everyday life.
We have this immense power that allows us to know everything, to communicate with the world, and to help us with many tasks so that we can save more time. It looks like that is what technology can do, but are we really doing?
We are face swapping on snapchat. We are yelling at each other on twitter about things we don’t even know. We are dividing ourselves from our friends when we sit on a dinner table. We are becoming more and more isolated, on the empty promise that what we are doing is to be “connected”.
I don’t know enough about this, and I am sure that there are other factors, but is it such a coincidence that suicide, depression, and anxiety rates in developed countries are at all time highs? [Source]. This immense power can also be yielded in a harmful way, and I think many of us have not been able to tell the difference.
Would you like to eat almost anything from almost anywhere? Have it delivered to your house within a few minutes by clicking on your phone a few times!
Would you like to know what movie to watch? Get thousands of reviews on thousands of movies by clicking on your phone a few times!
Would you like to have sex with someone? Well, why bother knowing the person? Just swipe right, swipe right, and swipe right, until the clicks connect and the two of you are locked in an empty dance through the ether!
The tasks of everyday life are being substituted by faceless processes which save us time but rob us of meaning. Our brain’s dopamine receptors are being manipulated in the same way they would as if we were addicts. [Source].
It has never been easier for one to be sucked in a vortex of illusions – all it takes is opening your choice of social media and browse through the apparently beautiful, meaningful, and happy lives of millions of people around the world. Is that really the case though?
Or, at the end of the day, is the person you are admiring just another human being on the other side of the screen. Another mysterious creature who will unequivocally suffer, fear, stumble, and face the intrinsic hardships of life; who will also eat, sleep, talk, walk, live and die.
Do we see the portrayals of ourselves, or do we see the real ourselves?
How real is all of what we see? How much of it was built on the premise that we should act accordingly to what other people will like, rather than what we really want to do. How sucked in are we in this vortex?
Make no mistake about it, I am part of it too. The internet has helped me in many ways – most notably, it allowed me to stay connected to friends who were very far away, supporting friendships which I hold on dearly to this day. I have also portrayed myself many times as someone who I am not, or at least, showing a very specific side of myself. We pamper ourselves for our pictures, we edit them, we think of funny things to say. We are trying to capture that attention, that feeling of belonging, the apparent rope through this illusion to really be seen as someone who is great, when in reality, it is you who says if you are great or not. It is an instinct for a human to want to belong, to be recognized – but we have taken this impulse to the limit, and we have done it through the infinite enhancement of social media, for one. Some of us, many of us, are much more concerned about what people will say of us than what we want. We pose for them, but the naked truth stares us blankly in the face.
My concern is that this wave of technology is atomizing us, ridding us of meaning which is an incredibly dangerous pit to fall in given the mysteries of reality, and to me, it looks like we live in this society where everyone is connect, social media, doing great, but in truth we are all humble monkeys floating through space not knowing shit from shit and we all need each other more than ever, to figure out the best path for us, but we don’t get there by talking to each other through text messages.
Is it hard to see that we are all the same building blocks in slightly differing arrangements floating on this huge raft adrift nowhere and that we do have a craving to belong and to care for each other, but we would rather hide ourselves and pretend to be people we want to be?
What I propose then, is change the game. Use this power for something good. Break out of what looks like the world is, and start shaping it to how you really want it to be. Maybe our moral responsibility in the information age is this, to use this power to know what is right and wrong, to be truthful, accepting, and open about the intricacies of life – after all, all of it is available to you right now.





















Closing the door
I hope that you might have gained some insight, your own insight, from reading what I just said. My goal here was to show you ways in which our world may look like something, but in fact be something entirely different. And I think there is benefit in recognizing these differences, because they help us become more grateful and humble about who we really are. What I really hope is that you might gain an appreciation for doing this sort of exercise in your own way, and figuring out new and better ways to see things, and build upon that to make your reality, and subsequently everyone else’s, better. After all, we are all in this together.
Don’t take anything for granted, and always look at things through different ways.
What does this all mean?
How could it be better?
What can you do?
Think deeply about the simple things!
