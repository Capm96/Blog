Black Holes – Gods dots.

Out there in the dark sky lies a gentle monster that would seem fictional if it were not all too real. But perhaps monster is too harsh a word, for it means no harm. Its only quarrel is with reality itself, and its attempts to push the fabric of everything to the limit.

There are things in the world that are beyond perplexing -- spiritual almost. Things that when thought about carefully will take one to a place of genuine awe. One of such things, in my opinion, is our consciousness. On one hand, it is the beginning of everything, the turning on of the lights, the definition of life itself. On the other hand, it is perhaps the most complex object in the entire universe, a conglomeration of atoms that sum up to something much, much greater than their individual parts.

This experience itself, of my writing or your reading, is a product of such consciousness, a hidden result of a process we simply do not fully understand yet. All it takes is a look inwards to realize the infinite marvel that resides in something which cannot even be touched! In short, it is everything.

The gentle monster in the dark sky is another of such awe-inspiring components of reality. It is another thing that makes reason leave the steering wheel and replaces it with the limitless potential of imagination.

This gentle monster is a black hole. It is a truly remarkable feat of human development that we are even able to talk about such things. For all their mystery and grandiosity, black holes are acknowledged as some of the most fascinating places on the entire universe.

This is an attempt of a silly monkey to touch the edge of the unknown.

## What is the recipe for a star? ##

A very long time ago, our universe began in a profound and interesting way. In less time than you can blink your eyes, the universe went from being smaller than the smallest thing you can think of, to being bigger than the biggest thing you can think of. This unimaginable expansion of spacetime is called the Big Bang – the moment of birth of the universe itself.  

Unlike how it is sometimes depicted, the Big Bang was not an explosion. It was, literally, the case where the edges of the universe were expanding very rapidly. There was nowhere for an explosion to happen because there was no space before the Big Bang. It was the creation of the canvas which everything lays on, rather than the splashing of some paint on top of the canvas.

The Big Bang brought along the ride a substantial, but fixed, amount of matter (atoms). **[1]** Shortly after the beginning of the initial expansion, the atoms began attracting each other through gravity. The same force that keeps us from floating into space today was the one who first brought together the atoms at the beginning of time.

When a lot of these atoms got lumped together through gravity, they began heating up. In general, things get warmer as you compress it, and the little particles at the beginning of the party were no different.

Eventually, there were so many atoms under such incredible temperatures that something incredible began happening. The atoms started fusing to become newer, heavier atoms -- this process of fusing atoms is called nuclear fusion.

Nuclear fusion is what powers stars, including our sun. That beautiful warmth on a sunny summer day, and that vital light that feeds life itself – they are both products of nuclear fusion. When atoms are under such extreme conditions (great pressure and great heat) they become something new and release a tremendous amount of energy in the process.

A star like our sun will maintain this process of nuclear fusion for a very long time. However, it does not last forever. **[2]**

## Turning inwards ##
Someone named Albert once came up with an equation: E=MC<sup>2</sup>.

This equation states that energy = mass * the speed of light<sup>2</sup>. This has so many beautiful repercussions worthy of their own discussions. For now, we are only interested in one, which states that matter and energy are the same thing, just in different forms.

The sun exposes this concept magnificently.

In the sun’s core, there is a lot of Hydrogen. Hydrogen is the lightest and simplest atom that exists. When two Hydrogen atoms undergo nuclear fusion, they become a single Helium atom, which is the next lightest and simplest atom on the periodic table. **[3]**

This seemingly simple fusion, however, is literally what allows us to live.

Let’s say that a Hydrogen atom weighs 1 kilo (a very fictional number for a very simplified demonstration). We could, reasonably so, expect the following to happen:
Hydrogen (1 kilo) + Hydrogen (1 kilo) = Helium (2 kilos).

But, the newly created Helium does not weigh 2 kilos. It weighs less (about 0.7% so).

Then, if 1 + 1 = something that is not 2 but almost so, where did that missing matter go?

It went into the warmth of our sunny days! Into the green of the trees, the blue of the skies, and the white of all light that we have so vitally chased after here on Earth since the beginning of life itself.

As E=MC<sup>2</sup> goes, energy and matter are the same thing – just in different forms. The missing matter from our Hydrogen + Hydrogen fusion was converted into energy – the energy we receive from the sun.

Nuclear fusion releases an unimaginable amount of energy. So much that it can cause skin burns even from 150 million kilometers away! It is extremely counter-intuitive to think about how big the sun is because our brains are not equipped for it.

However, think of a lit candle. The candle burns at the top, and if you put your finger on it, your finger will burn. If you move your finger away, it will not burn your finger, but it will heat it. You can control the temperature on your finger by moving it closer or further from the candle. There is a distance from the candle where your finger feels as warm as your finger would if you just put your hand out on a sunny day.

Let’s say that distance between your finger and the candle (which makes your finger feel as warm as it would on a sunny day) is 5cm. How extraordinary would something have to be to warm your finger the same way, but from 150 million kilometers?

The sun is 30 billion times as far away from you as that candle, yet they would both make your finger feel the same warmth. How gargantuan of a ball of fire must exist for that to be true?

In any case, when we look at the sun, it sure seems like a sphere. This is interesting because the sun is essentially a huge ball of gas that is so hot that it fuses its atoms and releases a massive amount of energy in the process. To contain such an extraordinary ball of gas in the spherical shape we have come to love so dearly, there needs to be an equally extraordinary gravitational force to keep it from blowing itself apart.

The sun’s gravity maintains the entire star in check. The nuclear fusion, and subsequent massive release of energy, is trying to push everything away, while gravity is trying to pull everything in. The result is the stable spherical star that keeps us warm every day.
However, nuclear fusion cannot last forever.
Then, if usually we have:

nuclear fusion + gravity = stability

What happens when we only have:

nada + gravity

The answer depends on how massive the star is. Some stars will explode in magnificent supernovas, some stars will become smaller versions of themselves, and some stars, the largest ones, will become black holes.

After a certain threshold **[4]** there is so much matter that nada + gravity results in an inward collapse that is unstoppable. With no nuclear fusion to push everything away, gravity keeps pulling the matter in and in and in, into an ever-smaller point in space. This is an unstoppable force, and the matter will continue to collapse at extremely high speeds into denser and denser regions of space. Eventually, this process reaches a point of such absurd implications that the universe itself glitches.

## Let there be dark ##
A black hole is black because it emits no visible light. It emits no light because it does not allow for light to escape its grip!

If you throw a ball up in the air, it will go up, lose speed, stop (momentarily) then fall back downwards (gravity is pulling). If you had Hulk’s strength and threw the ball up, it would keep going up and up and up until it escaped Earth, and then it would just fly into space. What is the difference between a ball that goes up and down, and a ball that only goes up?

In the case of the first, the ball was unable to break the Earth’s escape velocity. This means that it did not go fast enough, for long enough, to escape the Earth’s gravitational pull. Gravity was stronger than the force pushing the ball up. In the second case, however, it went so fast for a sufficiently long enough time that it escaped Earth’s gravity and flew outwards.

The Earth’s escape velocity is around 11 kilometers per second. This means that if something stays above this speed for a certain amount of time, it will leave the Earth. Rockets must achieve such speeds to be able to leave the planet.

A black hole, however… has an immeasurable escape velocity. It does not matter if you are Hulk throwing a ball upwards, or if you have the fastest rocket in the universe – doing such things in a black hole will get you nowhere.

Not even light can escape from it, and light travels at 300,000 km per second, which is more than 27 thousand times faster than the Earth’s escape velocity!

The point at which the gravity becomes so strong that light cannot escape is called the event horizon. The event horizon is the line which afterward, all becomes dark. It is the final cross from which there is no coming back from. In the picture below, it would be the edge of where the bright things become dark in the circle.

(Figure 1.2)

As a side note, this bright stuff around the black hole is an accretion disk. These are the remains of stars and other cosmic objects that got too close to the black hole, and are now being sucked in. Large clouds of matter can surround a black hole, and they are pulled in very fiercely, which heats them up substantially. The bright stuff around the header picture is also a black hole -- thanks to them we can see some light coming from the black hole.   

Once we cross the event horizon, we will be pulled by the black hole’s gravity towards the singularity. The singularity is where all that matter from the inward collapsing star goes to. The singularity is something that defies our current understanding of things – it is beyond our normal intuitions and makes no sense.

Open Google up, or find any calculator, and try to type “1/0”. Dividing 1 by 0 is generally met with an “Error” and rightly so – how can we divide one candy for zero people?

But dividing by zero is exactly what happens in a singularity!

If you were trying to calculate your body density, for instance, you would divide your weight by your size. We can try to calculate the density of a black hole in the same way. We know its mass (a lot) and we know its size (zero). Hence, the singularity is a place of apparent infinity density and the universe along with our reason goes kaput.

## Oddities ##
We know now a black hole is part of our sun’s family. It was once also a star, although a much larger one than our sun. Due to its incredible size, once it reached the end of its lifecycle, it had no more energy to counteract the tremendous gravity that it exerted, which prompted it to fall inwards on itself. This fall was unstoppable, and there was enough matter to create a point in space which makes no sense at all (a lot of matter in an infinitely small space, i.e. 1/0), a point of such magnitude that it breaks spacetime itself.

## Seeing the back of your head ##

The satellites that bless us with the GPS are in a stable orbit around Earth. That means that they keep going around the Earth in a balanced manner – they are neither falling inwards and crashing down nor flying outwards and floating in space. To maintain this balance, they need to fly around the Earth at a speed of approximately 11,000 kilometers per hour – more than ten times faster than a commercial airplane.

If these satellites slowed down, then gravity would pull them downwards faster than their speed “pushes” them forward, and they would crash. If they sped up, then gravity would not be able to hold them down, and they would fly away.

If we substituted the satellite for a light beam, it would immediately fly out into space, since its speed is 300,000 kilometers per second! The Earth’s gravity would not come close to holding this down into a stable orbit.

In a black hole, however, the gravity is so astronomically larger than even light itself could orbit the black hole. At a certain distance beyond the event horizon (where gravity becomes too strong and light can’t escape), there is a point where light can orbit the black hole.

So if you could, hypothetically, find yourself in that orbit, you would look straight ahead and find the back of your head, as the photons that came from the back of your head went into an orbit around the black hole and into your eyes.

Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your keenness to see the back of your head) this is only a theory – the orbit where photons could travel in a circle would be much too strong for humans, and we would fall in and become spaghetti.

## Spaghettification ##
The Earth and Moon have been interwoven in a cosmic waltz for eons. Bound by gravity, these two heavenly bodies will be locked together in motion through space for a long time.

One product of this dance is that we only see one side of the moon – always. The references to the “Dark Side” of the moon revel on this fact to some extent – there is the side which we always see, and there is this dark side which we can’t see (although it is not really dark, because the sun shines on it too, we just can’t see it because it is facing away from us). **[5]**

The moon also creates some interesting effects for us down here on Earth. One is the tides. We have all heard of it some way or another before – “Don’t go in the water now! It is high tide.”

Every day the water levels rise and fall. The reason they rise and fall is that the Moon’s gravity on Earth is not evenly distributed. The side of the Earth which is closest to the Moon will feel a higher gravity than the side of the Earth which is far away from the moon. This happens because gravity depends on distance, and the Earth is quite large!

In general, tides exist everywhere. Even now, on Earth, our feet are feeling a higher gravitational pull than our heads, but the difference is too small to notice it.

Near a black hole, however, the gravitational forces are so severe that an object does not have to be as large as the Earth to feel a difference in gravity between the part which is closer and the part which is farther from the black hole.  

To that extent, as a person would be falling in (feet first) their feet would begin to be pulled harder than their heads. A lot harder. This would elongate and stretch them, turning them into an ever-thinner straw, starting from the feet. This process would only get more explicit and dramatic as they kept falling in, until their feet became single atomic lines and what once was a human is now an atom pasta. This would keep happening all the way up to their heads. “Spaghettification” is a legitimate scientific term.

## Theories about what lies inside ##
There will always be people who claim that something is impossible. Doubt and skepticism have been omnipresent throughout history, and interesting ideas are always often met with a “this will never happen”.

Light without fire, putting a man on the moon, talking to someone in Australia from your home in New York… if we go back enough, a lot of what we have today seemed like an impossibility at some point.

To that extent, I will not say that it is impossible to know what is inside a black hole, but I will say that our current understanding of physics makes it a very difficult challenge to get around.

The main issue is the escape velocity, which literally will not let anything escape. The grip of a black hole beyond the event horizon is final. There is nothing, as far as we know, which can escape it.

To that extent, there is no way of sending something in and somehow getting information back. So how can we know what is inside?

The best we can do for the moment is to create a hypothesis, and eventually test them somehow when our technology is sufficiently advanced. There are a few interesting theories about what lies inside.

Some say that at the singularity lies another universe. Because spacetime is a fabric which can be bent and twisted, the singularity, with its infinite density, essentially pokes through this fabric and goes out somewhere else, into another universe. It could be, for instance, that the big bang is the “other side” of a black hole.

Alternatively, it could be that the singularity pokes through the fabric of spacetime, but just into another point into the universe. On the other side, the black hole could have a counterpart, a white hole, which ejects all the matter from the other side. We have no evidence of such things yet.

Other theories allude to the black hole being a time machine (although not any black hole will do this – it needs to possess certain characteristics) which would allow you to get in and get out at a different point in time.

## Detection Picture and gravitational waves ##
How do you see something which emits or reflects no light? This is difficult to do. Imagine for instance that you are in your room, and you have a black piece of paper that reflects no light. You throw this piece of paper around randomly and turn the lights off in your room. How would you know where the paper is? It emits no light, and it reflects no light, and its surroundings are as dark as it is.

Luckily, visible light (i.e., the stuff that we see in everyday life) is not the only type of light that exists. Visible light is only a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is a range of wavelengths that exist. [Picture]

An x-ray, for instance, works because it takes a picture at a different wavelength than the ones that your skin emits light in. This means that it does not care about what your skin looks like, but what is inside of it, bypassing the visible light wavelengths and only observing the ones that are in the x-ray wavelength.

Similarly, the ultraviolet rays that we worry about sometimes when going in the sun are present all around us. We just can’t see them because our eyes are not able to make sense of that wavelength, but they are there nonetheless.

In any case, we can’t see a black hole through visible light, but we can see it through the infra-red. This happens because near black holes, generally, there are other remains of stars that are being pulled. As this material falls in a black hole, it heats up, releasing energy and heat. This heat is visible if you are looking at it through the right lens.

I can’t do enough justice to how much effort went into taking the picture at the header of this post. A lot of brilliant people were involved in a global collaborative effort to push science to new frontiers. It is amazing that we can witness such a thing, so early into our human history.

Another interesting way of inferring the existence of black holes is by measuring gravitational waves.

Imagine yourself near a lake. A very still and calm lake. Then you throw a rock in it and watch how the ripples flow around where the rock fell. These waves were created by the rock falling in the water and disturbing the water.

Gravitational waves are similar in concept to the waves in the lake. Except that they don’t permeate through water, but through spacetime itself. The fabric behind everything is shaken and stretched when events massive enough happen – in particular, when two black holes are colliding.

<img src="/images/blog/blackholes/waves.gif" alt="not"
	title="Not Found" class="responsive" />

(Figure 1.4)

In another extraordinary feat of engineering, some brilliant people were able to detect such gravitational waves. The instrument they used for this is called LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory). The first observation was announced in 2016.

LIGO is an incredibly beautiful piece of engineering. The idea is to create some pipelines in very remote and isolated areas across the world. Then, people fire lasers within these pipelines. Lasers are extremely accurate, so their wavelength looks always the same – unless something disturbs them.

On LIGO, for instance, if a heavy enough truck passes by on a road even a few kilometers outside the pipelines, the laser wavelengths will be disturbed. The place needs to be cautiously protected from external influences to prevent interference with the lasers.

Then, people fire up the lasers and wait…

Eventually, they picked up some disturbances which were nearly identical across the different lasers in different parts of the world. These disturbances were caused by spacetime itself squeezing and stretching (albeit an extremely tiny amount – only detectable by high-accuracy lasers). This disturbance was caused by black holes colliding.

## Conclusion ##
In the poem that is reality, black holes seem to be the full stops between the sentences that describe the laws of the cosmos. Like full stops, black holes are neutral -- neither good nor evil – they simply delineate the limits of the story itself. They represent endings. They represent beginnings.


## Footnotes: ##
[1] For reasons which we yet do not understand, there was some left-over matter during this period. In theory, there should not have been any matter.

During the Big Bang, matter and anti-matter particles were coming in and out of existence, annihilating each other. For some unknown reason, matter outweighed anti-matter by a very tiny fraction (something like one billion and one particles of matter for one billion particles of anti-matter). This excess matter would eventually become you, the moon, and the stars. Indeed, every single atom in our bodies can trace back its ancestry to the Big Bang.  

[2] Nuclear fusion keeps mixing elements up until it reaches Iron. The Iron atoms are not able to be fused into anything new, and so the nuclear fusion process comes to a halt.
During the Big Bang, only a few elements were created – the simpler ones. Things like Hydrogen and Helium.

Then, during the lifetime of stars, heavier elements (up until Iron) were created. Finally, a lot of the more exotic and even heavier elements are only created with super-duper crazy conditions, like the massive explosions that take place in a star’s final days – a supernova. There, elements like copper, mercury, gold, iodine, and lead are created.

[3] Helium is the only element in the period table that was not discovered on Earth! It was inferred to exist by analyzing the sun’s spectrum (i.e. the light that it emits). Scientists could not find any element on Earth that had the same light signatures as Helium. It was only many years later that they would eventually find the element Helium here on Earth. Since they discovered the element coming from the Sun, they named it after the Greek Sun God (Helios).

[4] The Earth could become a black hole too! All we would have to do is compress every single atom that is on Earth into a space that has a radius no larger than 9 millimeters. Anything that has mass could become a black hole – all it takes is compressing it into an area with a small enough radius.

The physicist Karl Schwarzschild came with the formula for figuring this radius out – the Schwarzschild Radius. As an interesting side note, he came up with this solution in 1916, literally while on the battlefield in the first world war.

[5] The moon only shows one side to us because its rotation period (how long it takes to go around its axis) is equal to its orbit period (how long it takes to go around Earth) [show gif]. This is a result of tidal locking between the Earth and the moon, and a not so unusual phenomenon in our solar system. Pluto and its moon, Charon, are also tidally locked.
